# Music inventory

**Legendary** project with the goal of finding ALL the songs I like.

## Plan

1. List all ARTISTS that I ever listened to on Spotify = many artists.
2. List all SONGS by all those ARTISTS = **very** many songs.
3. Listen to all SONGs and give them a rating. Save rating somewhere.

Make a web app that you can play and rate these with.

- Test Node script for finding artists
    * Get a List of Current User's Playlists
- Test Node script for finding songs from artists
- Application where you can login, create playlist, listen to playlist and rate songs.

### Optimization

Instead of listening to 1000000 songs, maybe use 
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#category-personalization
and only check "top" songs?
