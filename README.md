# Music inventory

**Legendary** project with the goal of finding ALL the songs I like and storing the data into a database.

## Plan

1. List all ARTISTS that I ever listened to on Spotify = many artists.
2. List all SONGS by all those ARTISTS = **very** many songs.
3. Listen to all SONGs and give them a rating. Save rating to a database.

Make a web app that you can play and rate these with, so you can casually work on this huge project over time.
